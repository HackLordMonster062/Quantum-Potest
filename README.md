# Quantum Potest

_Quantum Potest_ is a video game inspired by Qunatum Mechanics, with the goal of exploring the whimsical nature of this sientific field by presenting unique and challenging puzzles derived from real-life observations.

_Quantum Potest_ is in very early development, with core mechanics currently being explored.

### Current features (Under experimentation):
- **Photons**: Fly around and hold energy. They will generally vanish when hitting an object, except for specific reflective surfaces. Being hit by a photon makes the player enter an "Excited" state for a limited time, in which they can phase through certain objects and walls.
- **Colored Keys** (still working on the naming): Can be used to open same-colored doors. A key can exist in a superposition of colors, meaning it fits into multiple types of doors, but once used it "collapses" into that color and can only be used on that type of door.
- **Layered Realities**: The player's character exists in a multiple, slightly different rooms simultaneously. Collisions in one room reflect in all other clones. In order to progress, the player must "prune" all undesired realities to collapse into the correct one.

### Plans and Ideas:
- Making Layered Realities involve other types of interactions rather than just collisions
- Anti-players, which when colliding with the player make the player (or in fact everything around them) move backwards through time, meaning all other game mechanics and interactions are flipped. 
For simplicity of logic and understanding this will probably exclude gravity and similar effects


## Disclaimer

_Quantum Potest_ is purely inspired by quantum mechanics and does not aim to mimic real-life physics accurately.
