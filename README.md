# Quantum Potest

_Quantum Potest_ is a video game inspired by Qunatum Mechanics, with the goal of exploring the whimsical nature of this sientific field by presenting unique and challenging puzzles derived from real-life observations.

_Quantum Potest_ is in very early development, with core mechanics currently being explored.

### Current features include:
- Photons that fly around and hold energy
- Photons will generally vanish when hitting an object, except for specific reflective surfaces
- Being hit by a Photon makes the player "excited" for a limited time
- In the "excited" state, a player can phase through specific objects.


## Disclaimer

_Quantum Potest_ is purely inspired by quantum mechanics and does not aim to mimic real-life physics accurately.
